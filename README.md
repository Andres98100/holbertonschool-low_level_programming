# Low-level programming

Module of **Low-level programming**, carried out during **Software Engineering studies** at **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
